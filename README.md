# TypingPractice
This is a personal project I developed to practice typing

To clone use command: git clone https://github.com/naveenerroju/TypingPractice.git
It is developed using Intelij IDE, java 17
For flow chart or other diagrams, used draw.io

There are 3 game modes:
1. Random words generator
2. Custom category
3. Custom text
9. Settings

# Random words generator
Random words generator will generate N number of random words. Default value of N is 10.

# Custom Category
There are few categories you can choose to get the text. The text which is relevent to that category will be randomly provided.
Now, there are 5 categories. More coming soon.
1. Colors, which will generate N number of random color names.
2. Fruit Names, which will generate N number of random fruit names.
3. Long Words, this category should contain the longest words in English. Currently, if you choose this feature, it will redirect to default/random mode. This feature is in progress.
4. Literature, This catergory will provide a random passage from greatest passages/opening lines in literature.
5. Poetry, which will provide a random poem. Enhancements are in progress.

# Custom Text
User can enter a text and practice the same text and test the Speed and accuracy

# Settings
Using settings, we can customize the number of words to test. The interface will ask us to enter a number and the program will generate that many words in either random game mode or Custom Category game mode.

# Instructions
Please mind the console you use to set the number of words to generate, usually depending on the console, the words will exceed the visible screen and its hard to type further.
